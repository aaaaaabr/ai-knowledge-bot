# AI Knowledge Bot ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **AI Knowledge Bot** repository! This project is my custom-built offline AI bot designed to facilitate conversations with PDFs and web pages. By leveraging local embeddings and local LLMs like LLaMA 3, I have created a solution that doesn't depend on external APIs. This bot allows you to interact with your documents seamlessly.
